</div>

**TiLab** is a web platform built with [Vue](https://vuejs.org) (front) and [gin](https://github.com/gin-gonic/gin) (back) dedicated to provide automated & economic Minecraft modded server running experience on Aliyun IaaS. It turns out to be feasible and effective, but not sustainable due to lack of players.

  - Front: https://github.com/seatitanium/lab-frontend
  - Back: https://github.com/seatitanium/lab-backend
- Status: Discontinued, but still deployable.

**Oasis** (formerly SoTap) is a Minecraft server with plugins created by me (tech leader) and [Sapherise](https://sapherise.me) (owner) in 2019, mainly running on Paper Spigot. The sevrer is shut down completely in early 2024. There are still some projects that remain.

- Created at: 2019
- Projects:
  - Sunstory, the 2nd version of SoTap website application built with Vue 2 (code are stored locally)
  - ceres, Oasis website application built with Vue 3 (code are stored locally)

## xenforo-markdown

**xenforo-markdown** is a set of scripts written in TypeScript (and compiled into JavaScript) to enable Markdown parsing on [XenForo](https://xenforo.com/) in an alternative way. It's originally made for [MineBBS](https://www.minebbs.net), and has been maintained until present.

## MDBottle

<div align="center">
<img src="https://i.loli.net/2018/10/06/5bb8c8b9499b2.png" height="300px"/>
</div>

**MDBottle** comes from [OBottle](https://github.com/SomeBottle/OBottle), a simple blog system created by [SomeBottle](https://github.com/SomeBottle) with PHP. It was my interest in Material Design by Google and my discovery of the component library [MDUI](https://github.com/zdhxiong/mdui) at the time that inspired me to make this branch version.

## Minecraft Assistive Plugins & Mods

**Assistive** here means that the plugins or mods provide only extra internal functionality rather than any new in-game experience.

- (2024, Forge & Fabric) [NameWhitelist](https://github.com/Subilan/NameWhitelist) - Plain text based Minecraft vanilla whitelist, without any online checks. Quite helpful for offline servers and server owners who are bothered by laggy `whitelist add/remove` due to poor Internet connection.
- (2023, Spigot) [VIPTimer](https://github.com/Subilan/viptimer) - Easily give/take VIP or VIP-like privileges to/from players.
- (2020, Spigot) [FlarumReader](https://github.com/Subilan/FlarumReader) - Read content from a forum based on Flarum through API in game. There's a side project [flarum-apidoc](https://github.com/Subilan/flarum-apidoc/blob/master/api.md) which contains my notes on then-incomplete Flarum API doc, written in Chinese.
- (2020, Spigot) [CustomDeathMessage](https://github.com/Subilan/CustomDeathMessage) - Customize player death message in Minecraft 1.16.
